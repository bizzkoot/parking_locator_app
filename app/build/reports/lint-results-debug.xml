        id="ScopedStorage"
        severity="Warning"
        message="WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE no longer provides write access when targeting Android 10+"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="8"
        summary="Affected by scoped storage"
        explanation="Scoped storage is enforced on Android 10+ (or Android 11+ if using `requestLegacyExternalStorage`). In particular, `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` will no longer provide write access to all files; it will provide the equivalent of `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` instead.&#xA;&#xA;The `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission can be used to manage all files, but it is rarely necessary and most apps on Google Play are not allowed to use it. Most apps should instead migrate to use scoped storage. To modify or delete files, apps should request write access from the user as described at https://goo.gle/android-mediastore-createwriterequest.&#xA;&#xA;To learn more, read these resources: Play policy: https://goo.gle/policy-storage-help Allowable use cases: https://goo.gle/policy-storage-usecases"

For a list of all predefined autofill hint constants, see the `AUTOFILL_HINT_` constants in the `View` reference at https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html.&#xA;&#xA;You can mark a view unimportant for autofill by specifying an `importantForAutofill` attribute on that view or a parent view.
